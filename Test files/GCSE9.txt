# Fully corrected algorithm to total ALL numbers in the array
# Fixed for FriendlyLang's 1-indexed arrays

# Create a sample scores array for testing
the scores is ["10", "20", "30", "40", "50"]

# Initialize total
the total is 0

# Alternative: Use for-each loop which is safer
the total is 0

for each score in scores : [
    the total is total plus score
]

# Display result
display "Total: " plus total
